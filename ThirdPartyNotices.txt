5.	LSODA (https://github.com/lh3/misc.git)


%% LSODA NOTICES, INFORMATION, AND LICENSE BEGIN HERE
================================================================
This is a C version of the LSODA library. I acquired the original
source code from this web page:

  http://www.ccl.net/cca/software/SOURCES/C/kinetics2/index.shtml

I merged several C files into one and added a simpler interface. I
also made the array start from zero in functions called by lsoda(),
and fixed two minor bugs: a) small memory leak in freevectors(); and
b) misuse of lsoda() in the example.

The original source code came with no license or copyright
information. I now release this file under the MIT/X11 license. All
authors' notes are kept in this file.
